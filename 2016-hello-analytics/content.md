time series databases
----------------------------------------------------

A Time Series DBMS is a database management system that is optimized for handling time series data: each entry is associated with a timestamp.

Examples of prominent time series databases are: OpenTSDB, InfluxDB, Prometheus, Graphite, ...
Most of them are by design single node. (Although there is a clustered version of enterprise InfluxDB available)

Vanity Metrics vs. Actionable Metrics
-----------------------------------------------------

> Vanity metrics? Good to feel awesome. Bad for insights.

* number of Hits
* number of Downloads 
* number of Likes
* number of (insert anything here)
