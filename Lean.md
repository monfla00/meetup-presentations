Why Lean Development?
-----------------------------------------------------

By following lean principles you will understand that this is the only way you will be able to deliver value to your clients in quality and time and give yourself a chance to innovate.

So where can I buy the tool? How much does it cost?

 --> It's not about the tool!

Statistics
-----------------------------------------------------

make it more likely to hit the jackpot by iterating faster.

Continuous Delivery
-----------------------------------------------------

feature toggles and trunk based development --> Continuous integration

---

Analyze adoption
----------------------------------------------------

Go through an iterative cycle to deliver incremental change to the customer (internal or external) and thoroughly analyze the adoption of the feature.

    --> Further develop features that the customers like.
    --> At the same time tweak or abandon features that the customers do not like.


It's all about customer value creation and satisfaction.  

---

Delivery pipeline
-----------------------------------------------------

commit --> build --> unit tests --> code style --> deploy --> integration tests --> performance tests --> exploratory manual testing

    --> Visualize progress on each stage.
    --> Establish quality gates at each stage.
    --> Stop progress if a quality gate is not met!

* reject or retain release candidates

Interview answers
-----------------------------------------------------

go through questions and show that with lean development you are having an understanding of this.
