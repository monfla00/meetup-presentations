Analyze Adoption
----------------------------------------------------

Go through an iterative cycle to deliver incremental changes to the customer (internal or external) and thoroughly analyze the adoption of the new feature.


> Further develop features that the customers like.


> At the same time tweak or abandon features that the customers do not like.



It's all about customer value creation and satisfaction.
